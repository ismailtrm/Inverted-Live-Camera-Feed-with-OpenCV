Here's a `README.md` file for the **Inverted Live Camera Feed** script, with detailed sections and properly formatted code blocks.

# Inverted Live Camera Feed with OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to invert the colors of a live camera feed using OpenCV.

## Overview

The script captures video from your webcam and inverts the colors of each frame in real-time. 

### Code

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Start the camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Check if the camera opened successfully
if not cap.isOpened():
    print("Error: Cannot open camera!")
    exit()

while True:
    # Read a frame from the camera
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # If the frame is not read correctly, exit the loop
    if not ret:
        print("Error: Cannot retrieve frame!")
        break

    # Invert the colors of the frame
    inverted = 255 - frame

    # Display the inverted frame
    cv2.imshow('Inverted Live Camera', inverted)

    # Exit the loop if the 'q' key is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the camera and close all OpenCV windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Starts the camera using `cv2.VideoCapture(0)`. The argument `0` refers to the default camera.

2. **Frame Capture**: Continuously captures frames from the camera in a loop.

3. **Color Inversion**: Inverts the colors of each frame by subtracting the pixel values from 255. This is done using the operation `255 - frame`.

4. **Display**: Shows the inverted frame in a window titled "Inverted Live Camera".

5. **Exit Condition**: The loop exits when the 'q' key is pressed, and the script then releases the camera and closes all OpenCV windows.

### Usage

- Run the script using Python.
- The live camera feed will be displayed with inverted colors.
- Press `q` to exit the application.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy
```
